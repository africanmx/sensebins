PROGRAM_NAME="cierra"
PROGRAM_VERSION="0.4"
### CHANGESET
### # 0.3-0.4 Moved from kill -9 to pkill. I really did not know that pkill existed :(
###           and so I just left this program because of the nostalgia. Also, added the
###           copycat ability to count the running processes with the -c option.
### # 0.2-0.3 Decoupled gender by adding alternative word la and las, as well as english
###           compatibility for people linking to an english word like close or something.
###           Also, the last chantset was never added sorry for that. I am cancelling it
###           in this message.
### # 0.1-0.2 Added the "sudando" post option
## Replace the > in the CONSOLE_THINGY
## with your own string like ~$ or ~#
## or whatever need. Leave a space for
## better esthetics in the console.
