$PROGRAM_NAME
   Version $PROGRAM_VERSION

	This is a program in test. Current known bug is length of data. You can encrypt a message with a max length of ~112 characters.

	Installation:
		Once you have $0 available, you need to generate your key pair to start encrypting and decyrpting messages.
		To do so, execute the program once like this:
			$0 --build
		If you do not want to be prompted (i.e. for scripting purposes), you can call it  like this:
			$0 --build --force

		It is important for you to know that if you run the --build, the program will replace your key pair with a new one, and thus
		all previous encrypted messages will not be able to be decrypted unless you have a copy of the keys.
		As for now, this program does not have the option to restore keys or to use custom keys to decrypt messages. If you want to recover
		encrypted messages with different keys, you could manually replace them and use this program normally. Probably doing it in a different
		directory would be the best option.
		If you could add this last described functionality to this program please share it as a pull request so we can integrate those changes
		to the repository.


	The encrypted messages can be thought as a LIFO queue. Executing with "p" and "nd", will delete the message that is being displayed.

	Usage:
		mvv s [your message]		Saves your message, encrypted
		mvv l				Prints the last message, decrypted
		mvv p				Pops the last message, decrypted
		mvv n				Prints the n'th message, decrypted
						The messages are ordered from newest to oldest, and they start with number 1
		mvv nd				Prints the n'th message and deletes it afterwards. After this happens, all
						oldest messages positions are moved up by one. If you call again the program
						with the "n" option, then it will print the message that took place once the
						other one was removed

		mvv --pop-all			With confirmation from the user, it pops all the encrypted messages and leaves the program empty.
		mvv --pop-all --force		Performs the "mvv --pop-all" without a user's confirmation.

	mvv --version 		Prints $PROGRAM_NAME version.
	mvv --help 			Prints this screen.
