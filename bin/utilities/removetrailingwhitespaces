$PROGRAM_NAME
   Version $PROGRAM_VERSION

Removes trailing spaces at the end of each line of the file that you want to apply the removetrailingwhitespaces filter. This program uses sed.

usage:
	removetrailingwhitespaces [file]			Prints out the [file]'s contents without the trailing spaces of each line.

other options:
	removetrailingwhitespaces [file] --replace		Instead of printing out the output, it replaces the original file.
	removetrailingwhitespaces [file] --out [out file]	Instead of printing out the output, it writes it into a file.

	removetrailingwhitespaces --version 			Shows removetrailingwhitespaces version.
	removetrailingwhitespaces --help 			Shows this screen.
